## Sample usage

This snippet creates a backup vault and plan for RSS prod. The AWS account number "123456789012" and ARN
 is the locked vault created by the vault module in a separate AWS account.

Local copies of the snapshots are held for 7 days and remote "tamper-proof" copies for 90 days. The backup
 runs at 11:15 every day and backs up all assets in the prod environment (as defined by the Environment tag)
 with the BackupRemote Tag set to true

```
module "rss_prod_backup_vault" {
  source = "../modules/backup"

  instance_name      = "rss-prod"
  remote_accountount = "123456789012"
  remote_vault_arn   = "arn:aws:backup:eu-west-2:123456789012:backup-vault:rss_prod_backup"
  local_lifecycle    = 7
  remote_lifecycle   = 90
  backup_schedule    = "cron(15 11 ? * * *)"
  use_env            = true
  environment        = "prod"
}
```
